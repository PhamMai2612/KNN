And so the way that is done, there's a few ways that it was done. You know we think about that happening through the process of politics and candidate messaging, right? From the kind of top down. That candidates find ways to weave together big enough constituencies that they can win a plurality of the votes and become the nominee of a party. And that's something that we saw in 2008, between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.

So, there's the candidates and their messages and what they're trying to do in terms of the ways that they sort of focus their appeal. But then there's the organizing work that happens on the ground, and that organizing work happens away from the spotlight of the national political media. It happens anonymously. It happens day in, day out in small community based organizations that are often stitched together through non-profit networks, that kind of harness their power collectively to put forward an agenda.", "If you're trying to talk about what is the base of the Democratic party, that's a good a place to go as any.

The power that gets built at the local level, the mobilization that happens at the local level, the voting registration that happens at the local level, the constituencies and social capital that are built at the local level, the enthusiasm that's built.

Yeah, weird story.", "CHRIS HAYES: Did someone kidnap you in the dark of night and take you to Yale, is that how you found yourself there?", "DORIAN WARREN: You know, I had an undergraduate mentor who knew I was kind of an activist and I was headed into law school and she was like, \"You should think about Ph.D. programs.\" Just to get the letter of recommendation from her for law school, I said I'd apply to Ph.D. programs and then when all was said and done, Ph.D. was free and law school was a lot of money.", "CHRIS HAYES: Yeah, dude.", "DORIAN WARREN: And then, so I went to New Haven and I loved New Haven, I didn't like Yale, but I ended up moving back home after three years and organizing with the Hotel Workers Union for two years.", "CHRIS HAYES: Wait, how'd that happen?", "DORIAN WARREN: Because I was burned out from school and the graduate T.A. Union effort at Yale, at the time, I became an organizer for that. It was run by the same union. So the Hotel Workers' Union represents all the Yale workers, the dining hall workers, the clerical workers, and then they were organizing graduate students, so I got to know the union that way and then I was like, \"fuck this,\" I want to move back home, take a break from school. So I organized for two years and then decided to finish my Ph.D. and then launched, you know, my academic career.", "CHRIS HAYES: So you already had the ... I mean you were ... Like you said your mom was a union member-", "DORIAN WARREN: Yeah.", "CHRIS HAYES: You were a son of black south side of Chicago, right?", "DORIAN WARREN: Exactly, exactly.", "CHRIS HAYES: You kinda had that world view politics, but-", "DORIAN WARREN: Yes.", "CHRIS HAYES: What changed in you when you became part of a union drive? 'Cause I feel like there's a really interesting thing that happens to people's psyches. Even people with liberal politics, because of the ways in which a union drive is a kind of psychological experience?", "DORIAN WARREN: Yeah, yeah, you know, I'll tell you this. My first campaign, my first political campaign ever was Jessie Jackson, Jr's special election in 1995 and I was really enamored with him. He was like ... and you covered him back in the day. He was a really diehard progressive in Congress. But I remember seeing the limitations of elected office. And so, when I joined the union, and I just knew collective action, solidarity, union organizing strikes was something different, and I think for me when I joined and then when I became an organizer, it was really a different form of power at the end of the day.", "So let me fast forward. Like when I was working with the hotel workers to imagine 60 rank and file workers, mostly housekeepers, mostly women of color, at a negotiating table, with 30 hotel employers. Like that to me was a different kind of power. You know they were sitting there with the union staff, but they were really the leaders, leading that negotiation, which is just a different way of democracy and sharing power in this country, then say representative democracy, right, in terms of how we think of elected officials.", "So I think there was something I always understood. Broadly speaking around the power of collective action that's different than supporting an individual candidate whose policies I might support, but then I feel disempowered for two years until election day.", "CHRIS HAYES: But here's the thing though that I find. I've never been part of a union campaign, but I've covered them and I've been around organizers. One of the things that I think is hard and I think it's actually kind of almost a psychological personality disposition that is, forms part of the wedge between liberal and leftist, is you gotta get real comfortable with comfort and disruption and polarization. In fact, the point of an organizer, the reason the labor song is \u201cWhich Side are You On,\u201d is to polarize a workplace.", "When liberals ... well that's divisive, it's like, dude that's my job.", "DORIAN WARREN: Yes.", "CHRIS HAYES: My job is to be divisive. It's to get people on one side or the other of stuff. You know I guess I just have a kinda lame conflict averse personality or just, I don't know, do we have to fight about this? But you got to get real used to that, like particularly if you're an organizer.", "DORIAN WARREN: Yeah.", "CHRIS HAYES: Like how easy was it for you to internalize that?", "DORIAN WARREN: It was rough for me.", "CHRIS HAYES: It was, that's not natural for you?", "DORIAN WARREN: Now it's not natural for me. No, but the think about labor organizing ... Well, all right, two things here. One is any kind of ... whether it's community organizing or labor organizing, you have to take people's identities as they are and then reconstruct a collective identity. So there's a lot of invisible labor, lots of conversations, lots of getting people to do things together they normally wouldn't do to try to construct a different collective identity than how they show up at work or in school or in the neighborhood, right?", "So that's like the more exciting part to me. It's really the social construction of race and identity on some level, right? Because you have to reshape someone's identity.", "CHRIS HAYES: In real time?", "DORIAN WARREN: In real time.", "CHRIS HAYES: That's what you're doing.", "DORIAN WARREN: And then get them to do things, to take action. And in the case of a strike, to get them to take the riskiest action, right? And in a non-union workplace where they can get fired and lose their livelihoods. That's the more exciting part. The harder part is the conflict. The harder part is actually going on strike and beating up the employer and the boss. But here's the thing about labor organizing that's different from other organizing the left. At the end of the day you have to get peace. You have to sit down and negotiate and then go back to work the next day.", "CHRIS HAYES: Right.", "DORIAN WARREN: That's different. That's a different kind of conflict 'cause you still have to work together 365 days of the year when the thing is over, as opposed to I think a lot of us, we can ... It's easy for me to run a campaign now and beat up on somebody, I never have to talk to them or negotiate with them.", "CHRIS HAYES: But that's also why it's so discomfiting.", "DORIAN WARREN: Yes.", "CHRIS HAYES: That's why workplace politics and the militancy of labor is so discomfiting, because you know like, in a campaign you're just gonna beat the crap out of the boss.", "DORIAN WARREN: Yeah.", "CHRIS HAYES: Who is the boss but also a human being.", "DORIAN WARREN: Exactly.", "CHRIS HAYES: And maybe you even like the person or you like the person that is the deputy of that person, you joke ... You know, it's the intimacy and proximity of that that is so electric, but hard.", "DORIAN WARREN: Yeah, but it's just like ... think of it this way, I have fights with my partner, I have fights with my family.", "CHRIS HAYES: Right.", "DORIAN WARREN: And we go on, but it's 'cause we've learned the tools to fight to not take it personally in the same way and that takes work, right? I wasn't born knowing how to fight with my partner, in a constructive way, right? We learn that, those are growing pains. You might think of a union as a tool to have that fight when there's inherently unjust power relations at play.", "CHRIS HAYES: That's a great way of thinking about it, because also that think you're saying about the partnership, right? So when you're working at the Hotel Workers Union and it's time to negotiate that contract and it's on the bargaining committee, 60 largely women of color-", "DORIAN WARREN: Yep.", "CHRIS HAYES: We're gonna talk, sit across from the CEO and management and fancy lawyers-", "DORIAN WARREN: Exactly.", "CHRIS HAYES: That never happens in American life.", "DORIAN WARREN: No.", "CHRIS HAYES: That's the only place it happens.", "DORIAN WARREN: So then imagine if you're an immigrant woman or black woman who's done that, you've not only negotiated across from multi-millionaire bosses and their lawyers, but you've won, then imagine how empowering that is around a situation in your neighborhood with a local city council person, or even you know, with frankly an abusive spouse. It teaches you something about power and personal efficacy, and I've actually seen it, you know, from when I was organizing, but we see this all across the country when people, especially workers and especially women, are empowered around the boss, they're empowered in other spheres of their lives.", "Now I haven't seen any research papers on this, I can't quantify this, but it's actually a really significant thing that people don't learn any other ... I don't find people learn in regular civic organizations in America. I think it is something unique to a union.", "CHRIS HAYES: So you do this union work and then you decide you're going to go back to grad school, you get a Ph.D., and you're a political scientist who studies race and class basically?", "DORIAN WARREN: Exactly, exactly. And new ways of organizing a multi-racial workforce. Like how do unions construct a collective identity among immigrant and native born? White, black, Asian, Latino, Latinx, those with disabilities. Like how do you construct a collective identity where people are willing to fight for each other? I mean that's the true meaning of solidarity, ultimately.", "That's what I wrote about and that's what I did for a little while, but then I was really curious. Like what are the lessons learned? Both historically in this country, but also in this period. You know it was the early 2000s, so there's a lot of talk about the changing nature of the economy. We were going from manufacturing to service. This is really before the threat of automation and artificial intelligence and technology and all that. It was really like, \"Okay so all the jobs are going to be service jobs,\" there has to be a different way to organize these workers and in particularly low wage workers in the labor market. So I was really curious to unpack what are the principals, what are the generalizable lessons on how to do this work well and how to organize in a new way.", "You know this has been an Achilles heel in American democracy, right? Of what does inclusive populism look like? What does an inclusive democracy look like? We've always stumbled on questions of race and other forms of difference. That's really what animated my academic work.", "CHRIS HAYES: That's so fascinating, 'cause what you're working on academically and what you're talking about being involved in on the front lines of union organizing, is literally the question of our politics at this moment.", "DORIAN WARREN: Yes.", "CHRIS HAYES: How do we construct robust solidaristic pluralistic identities that bind people together to take on power hierarchies in which they all feel connected to and equal with each other. And that's hard.", "DORIAN WARREN: It's the hardest work and we take shortcuts.", "CHRIS HAYES: What do you mean by that?", "DORIAN WARREN: Jane McAlevey has a book called \"No Shortcuts\" on how you actually do union organizing in a way that it involves hundreds and thousands of conversations.", "CHRIS HAYES: Right.", "DORIAN WARREN: That are very difficult to have. I can't tell you how many times we would do house visits. Because of labor law, as being union organizer, you can't be on the employer's property, right? They have a right to kick you off and bar you. So you have to go to people's houses and that's already a difficult thing 'cause no one wants to ... Who wants to talk to a union organizer after work when you're trying to be with your family.", "CHRIS HAYES: Good God.", "DORIAN WARREN: And like just rest, right? You're exhausted.", "CHRIS HAYES: Dude if someone showed up at my house at night-", "DORIAN WARREN: Right, if I show up at your house at night and you don't know me, I'm like, \"Hey, I'm from the union Chris, let me in for a conversation.\" You're going to be like, \"Get the hell out of here,\" right?", "CHRIS HAYES: Do you do those calls?", "DORIAN WARREN: Yeah. So it's like you have to do it in person, that's the thing, right? 'Cause someone-", "CHRIS HAYES: You can't tweet at someone? You can't be like #unionyes.", "DORIAN WARREN: No and so it takes getting in the door, having a conversation and then asking to do it again and like working with someone through say, like most people we're not primed in America to really, really believe in collective action especially against an authoritarian workplace. That's just not what we're trained in school to do. So you have to convince someone that if they join with their fellow workers, who might look different, that they actually have power. And if they take this risky action, maybe it's just a rally at work but it could be a strike, that they can actually succeed, and they won't get fired. Even though you have to actually inoculate and say, \"Yeah, there's a chance you might get fired.\" Those take lots and lots and lots of conversations and asking people to do things to put them in motion, to get them to turn out to something. That's not just a Twitter conversation.", "CHRIS HAYES: Right.", "DORIAN WARREN: Right, that's not just, \"I'm going to call you out and write you off.\" Because a lot of it is persuasion and convincing someone to think about themselves in a different way. That takes a long time. It takes a lot of conversations and it's a lot of work. And it's slow and painful sometimes.", "CHRIS HAYES: You also can't ... What I just heard from you, and I want to zoom in on this if it's okay ... You can't be like, \"You're problematic. You're canceled.\"", "DORIAN WARREN: Exactly.", "CHRIS HAYES: If you're at the door with a worker.", "DORIAN WARREN: The boss wins in cancel culture, like in this case.", "CHRIS HAYES: That's really an interesting ... The ideas of canceled, called out or problematic or whatever, you've got to work with whoever the workers are and whatever views they have.", "DORIAN WARREN: Exactly. My mother was a school teacher so it's a basic principle of education and pedagogy. You got to start where people are.", "CHRIS HAYES: You just to work with them and invest in them.", "DORIAN WARREN: You have to invest in them, and that's how you build power. First you have to believe people can change. And you have to believe that they can become their best selves. And then you have to do the slow, painful work of conversations, hard conversations, where you explore with folks based on where they are and you give them a vision of where they can go and why it will benefit them. A lot of my work as an organizer is teaching people their fates are linked with people that don't look like them. And if you can move people to that place where they're willing to take an action or vote a certain way or maybe strike the boss, that's transformative. And then you actually have persuaded people to not only realize their own power and share it with others, that's on the route to transformation of the country.", "CHRIS HAYES: We've had other organizers, George Goehl, who I know you know and are friends with, on the show. We talked about organizing in a very different setting. And I grew up in a family of organizers. My brother's an organizer, my dad's an organizer. I always have this question about organizing that I want to ask you, if you will just stay with us one second while we take a quick break.", "DORIAN WARREN: Absolutely.", "CHRIS HAYES: I'm going to ask you on the other side of this.", "So here's my question about organizing. And this goes something deep in different kinds of organizing, labor organizing, community organizing. There's this question of are you implementing the will of these folks as a follower, as a servant to their interests? Or are you really manipulating them to get them to do what you want to do? You come into a workplace and you have an ideology about the boss. You have an ideology about labor power. They don't necessarily have that. Maybe they like their workplace. Maybe it's not that exploitative. But you're not going to, as a labor organizer, you're not going to take that for an answer.", "DORIAN WARREN: Yeah.", "CHRIS HAYES: You're going to go on a series of exploration and conversations to lead them to what you're already ideological conclusion is.", "DORIAN WARREN: Yeah.", "CHRIS HAYES: I always wonder to the degree to which that's a good faith interaction, in the same way that when a Jehovah's Witness knocks on the door. That's a one-way conversation. You're not going to convince them to be an atheist. They already know the truth and they're there to get you to that truth.", "DORIAN WARREN: Yeah.", "CHRIS HAYES: How do you avoid essentially being, I don't know what the right word is, manipulative in this undertaking?", "DORIAN WARREN: In all honestly, it's slightly manipulative. But it's the same as what school teachers do every day.", "CHRIS HAYES: Right.", "DORIAN WARREN: So there's a difference between saying, \"Here is the faith, you have blind allegiance to it,\" versus the best organizers are more Socratic and are raising critical questions and actually developing people's critical consciousness to ask hard questions about power. And once you learn that skill, then you have a choice that you can actually make around do I want to join this union or not? Do I want to join this organization or not? You have a critical consciousness in a different way versus just the blind faith. And I would say the most progressive churches do the same thing.", "CHRIS HAYES: Yeah.", "DORIAN WARREN: They give you a moral grounding, but then they're asking critical questions too. I'll never forget as a youth going to a black church in Chicago on the south side and hearing a different interpretation. It was actually during the 1995 budget fight with Newt Gingrich who was trying to cut welfare programs. And I heard the minister talk about how Joseph and Mary were having premarital sex and had a out-of-wedlock baby. And it was a whole different paradigm shift for me. I was like, \"Oh, huh, I never thought about it that way. Okay, I can understand politics through this moral lens.\"", "CHRIS HAYES: Right.", "DORIAN WARREN: And it's not asking me to blindly believe a myth of immaculate conception. It actually resonated with my experience.", "CHRIS HAYES: So the other part of it that I think is really interesting and so relevant to now, because I want to segue us to what you do now and I think you're very in touch with what the progressive left and liberal grassroots is doing, is just the fact that because of the rise of polling and because of the shortcuts we take in punditry. And, god, I hate pundits. They're the worst.", "DORIAN WARREN: Hey, hey, hey, watch it there, brother.", "CHRIS HAYES: The worst kind of person. Anytime anyone calls me a pundit I'm like, \"Okay, that hurts.\"", "DORIAN WARREN: That is not a collective identity I want to share with other people.", "CHRIS HAYES: Exactly. That is not my collective identity. The shortcut is to talk about public opinion like this thing that's organic and out there. And one of the points of organizing in any form is it's not a formed thing. Most people don't have super formed views on these political questions because their attention is focused on other things, which is how to make rent that month and how to care for their sick mom, and the fact that their son has a learning disorder that they're trying to get help for. It isn't to say they don't have political views.", "DORIAN WARREN: Right.", "CHRIS HAYES: People do have politics. There's just a lot of unformed stuff in what we call public opinion. The point is that that isn't just some natural resource that you basically dig out of the ground and then you put it in the oven, the coal-fired oven, to fire the engine of progress. You make public opinion in some ways.", "DORIAN WARREN: Yeah. Wearing my political scientist hat for a second, so one of the things we know from decades of research is that public attitudes, public opinion, they're very unstable. Attitudes are unstable and malleable. And contradictory.", "CHRIS HAYES: Hella contradictory.", "DORIAN WARREN: So what we know about Americans in terms of the American welfare state, Americans are philosophically conservative but operationally liberal. So if I ask an average, white American, \"What do you think of government support?,\" blah, blah, blah. They'll say, \"Smaller government, lower taxes.\" This is also the result of 30 years of right wing rhetoric too. And then if I say, \"Well, what do you think about social security?\" \"Oh, I'm all for it.\" \"Oh, what do you think about this program? What do you think about SNAP?\" \"All for ...\". So, programmatically, if you ask people, \"Should we be spending money on programs?,\" they'll say yes.", "CHRIS HAYES: Right.", "DORIAN WARREN: But then if you ask a philosophical question, they'll say no. Well that's contradictory. So what do you do with that? And organizing is similar to market research, in my view. Consumer marketing figures out how to sell you things you don't want. You're not born wanting a pair of Air Jordans or a Coca-Cola. That is constructed. Or like an iPod.", "CHRIS HAYES: I was born wanting a pair of Air Jordans, thank you very much, Dorian Warren. Dude, when I think about the fights I had with my parents over Air Jordans when I was nine years old ...", "DORIAN WARREN: Oh, I did too. Oh my god.", "CHRIS HAYES: And they were 100 percent ... I thought it was the most unjust bullshit in the world that my parents would not fork over $100, $100 in 1989 dollars, for a pair of sneakers for a kid ...", "DORIAN WARREN: In 1989 dollars, right. Exactly.", "CHRIS HAYES: ... that will outgrow them in three g*****n months. I was like, \"What is this? Stalin's Russia? What is wrong with you people?\"", "DORIAN WARREN: But you weren't born wanting them. Somehow you saw some images, probably of Michael Jordan in the air, and you were like, ...", "CHRIS HAYES: No, I saw my buddy, Cicero, had a pair. And he looked dope.", "DORIAN WARREN: Exactly. But here's the punchline, I think on the right, when they think about public opinion, they're thinking about changing the temperature. Liberals or progressives think about taking the temperature. And public opinion is only ever a snapshot in time.", "CHRIS HAYES: Yeah.", "DORIAN WARREN: People change. Attitudes change. When Dr. King was assassinated in 1968, 75 percent of white Americans despised him, based on polls. Now we revere him.", "CHRIS HAYES: Right.", "DORIAN WARREN: Right. So people change. Attitudes change.", "CHRIS HAYES: It's funny, too, because we've seen it on LGBT issues.", "DORIAN WARREN: Exactly.", "CHRIS HAYES: And we're seeing it on marijuana too. What's weird is that there's two things going on, which is that individual persuasion seems harder and harder. Persuadable voters seem like less and less of a thing because everyone seems so polarized. But persuasion as a collective entity over time does seem possible. So people are super polarized in their camps.", "DORIAN WARREN: Yes.", "CHRIS HAYES: But then certain ideas have won the battle over time, thanks to a lot of organizing and persuasion work.", "DORIAN WARREN: Exactly. And change in norms and laws.", "CHRIS HAYES: Right. So those self-reinforcing.", "DORIAN WARREN: So once the Supreme Court said we have marriage equality ...", "CHRIS HAYES: That's interesting.", "DORIAN WARREN: ... then people said, \"Okay.\"", "CHRIS HAYES: That that actually does part of the work.", "DORIAN WARREN: Wait for attitudes to catch up.", "CHRIS HAYES: That does part of the actual opinion work.", "DORIAN WARREN: Yes, exactly.", "CHRIS HAYES: That's really interesting. I hadn't thought about that, but that's a great point. All this gets to how up for grabs in some ways all this stuff is and how it can't be done without the substructure of organizing, institutions, points of contact, conversations, which is what you work now. So you were an academic. You were a labor organizer. You were an academic for a long time. You decided to leave academia.", "DORIAN WARREN: I became a pundit for a bit.", "CHRIS HAYES: You were a pundit for a bit, the disgraceful period that we won't mention. No, you're an incredible communicator. It comes very naturally to you. And, obviously, punditry, organizing and teaching, academia, are all different forms of communicating and storytelling. But you're now doing this thing that I think is fascinating, which is you run Community Change.", "DORIAN WARREN: Yes.", "CHRIS HAYES: What is that organization?", "DORIAN WARREN: So Community Change is a national organization based in Washington DC, founded in 1968 to be the living memorial to Bobby Kennedy, especially his attempt to electoralize the issue of poverty in America. And we work with over 200 grassroots organizations around the country to support their efforts to build power for low-income people and especially communities of color.", "CHRIS HAYES: Wow.", "DORIAN WARREN: So we believe in building power from the ground up. And we serve this inside-outside role. So we connect these over 200 grassroots groups around the country to what's happening in DC and federal policy, as well as support them in local and state campaigns around social economic racial justice. That's the one sentence sound bite of what I do. I never imagined I'd be running an organization.", "CHRIS HAYES: Right.", "DORIAN WARREN: Which is a different things.", "CHRIS HAYES: Yeah. I'm not surprised. I think from the time I met you, this seems like a perfect gig for you. Because you're a very charismatic leader, but you've also got these incredible overlapping backgrounds. But this position puts you ... Similar, I think, to our conversation with George Goehl where you're connected to people having the actual conversations, doing the actual work every day, everywhere around the country.", "DORIAN WARREN: Yep.", "CHRIS HAYES: Where are we at right now? We're entering 2020. I hear things about the Democratic base. I read polling. I read campaign snapshots. And I thought to myself: \"If I want to talk to someone about where we're at, the Democratic base, Dorian's as good as anyone because his organization is a confederation of all these different organizations that are actually just day-in, day-out working among the constituencies that we would consider the Democratic base.\u201d", "DORIAN WARREN: So where the base is, I think it's contradictory, honestly. On the one hand, I think the base, and particularly if you think of the immigrant rights movement, of black communities, of poor people, people are exhausted.", "CHRIS HAYES: Yeah.", "DORIAN WARREN: I feel every day, I just feel racially exhausted, being a black man in America. Like, \"What am I doing?\" So people are exhausted of fighting defensive battles for things we thought we won with certainty a generation ago, so whether it's around racial justice or immigrant rights or gender justice and having to fight these defensive battles to save healthcare or food stamps or to push back against draconian and racist immigration policy, jobs in the labor market, people are just exhausted from the defensive fights, on the one hand. On the other hand, I am sensing around the country this feeling of excitement and exhilaration around what it feels like is a potentially transformative moment in American politics. I think you've said this, I think I've said this, the 2020 primary, at least on the Democratic side, it's the ideas primary.", "CHRIS HAYES: Yeah.", "DORIAN WARREN: And it's not incremental policy ideas.", "CHRIS HAYES: No.", "DORIAN WARREN: It is big, transformative stuff that I don't think we've really encountered in our lifetime. We did not have this policy or issue debate in 2008. We didn't have it 2000. Didn't have it in '92. When was the last time we had a political election cycle where candidates are putting big, bold, transformative policy ideas on the agenda? And so that's the flip side of the exhaustion is people want to be on the offense. They want an affirmative, positive vision of what the country should be and what the world should be. And there's an added sense, I think, in our lifetime, in this moment, of urgency because of the climate crisis. So I do think there is this combination of exhaustion but also excitement that we have to act and be bold in this moment, because we don't have a lot of time.", "CHRIS HAYES: Do you feel that in the groups that you are connected to, the climate part of it? Let's say there's an immigrant rights group in New York called Make the Road that does amazing work, just totally.", "DORIAN WARREN: They are amazing. They're one of our partners. And we're very proud to support them.", "CHRIS HAYES: They are kick ass. They will straight up kick your ass.", "DORIAN WARREN: Yes. No matter who you are.", "CHRIS HAYES: It doesn't matter who you are, they will kick your ass. And they're just really an incredibly impressive group. But if I'm organizing on behalf of marginalized communities in New York City that have high levels of undocumented folks who are getting deported left and right and abused by the system, I don't know, climate seems a little remote in that context. So I just wonder how much that issue is present across these different issue spaces and different places people are coming from with extremely life or death pressing issues in front of them.", "DORIAN WARREN: Yeah. I do think it's there. And I think it's been growing for the last two or three decades. If you go back in time to really the foundation of the environmental justice movement, particularly in black communities, of communities of color, and I would include immigrant communities here, you just ask, \"Where do people live?\" And it doesn't take you long to figure out, \"Oh, they live really close to a toxic dump site.\"", "CHRIS HAYES: Yeah.", "DORIAN WARREN: So there's environmental danger all around. Or if you think of New York and Sandy, who was most affected by the storm in terms of who had the resources to be resilient, when their homes were destroyed, and who did not? It takes you to low income communities, communities of color, immigrant communities. So there is, I think more now than ever, a fusion of climate justice issues with a range of other racial and economic justice issues. And I think the Green New Deal and the conversation were having about that idea is actually accelerating it.", "CHRIS HAYES: That's interesting.", "DORIAN WARREN: Because I think people can see themselves in it in a way that's different than how we've talked about climate change before.", "CHRIS HAYES: Right.", "DORIAN WARREN: Because it links jobs. It links economic security. It links all these things in three words, which is what the right is really good at doing, and we haven't been on the left.", "CHRIS HAYES: There's interesting things happening. And politics is such a complicated, layered set of forces, institutions. There's tens of millions of Democratic primary voters and there's hyper-engaged folks who are hosting the living room get together for Cory Booker in Iowa.", "DORIAN WARREN: Yep.", "CHRIS HAYES: That's one. But that's a small percentage of the voters, but they have a outside influence. Then there's donor class. There's the think tank world. There's all sorts of policy elites. I guess one question I have is there's a sense in which things are moving to the left, I think. And I always wonder how much of this is a vanguardist effect? Meaning, is it that the activist class and the think tank class, which is not like the rich, donor class necessarily, it's a different part of this coalition, are they moving to the left and pushing people? Is that a real thing that's happening at the grassroots on the ground? Is that even a dumb question because of all the troubling we just did about public opinion?", "DORIAN WARREN: No.", "CHRIS HAYES: How do you think about that?", "DORIAN WARREN: I think it's two things. I think you're right in some ways about the vanguardist nature of this. But let me give you two different examples, one that'll be controversial. The first is if you think of ... When I was a political scientist, I was doing research on inequality and reading all the latest social science on income inequality and wealth inequality and wage stagnation, all that stuff. And it never broke through really in popular discourse until movement moments. So you had Occupy Wall Street, and then, when Occupy started to die down, you had this crazy thing called the Fight for $15, of workers who were like, \"You know what? I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald's, at Burger King, and I'm going to go on strike for a day to raise attention and put $15 on the agenda.\" By the way, at the same time, liberal economists were saying $15 was too much, just you'd be happy to get to $10. So that was a combination of ...", "CHRIS HAYES: That's interesting.", "DORIAN WARREN: ... workers, mostly workers of color, in the fast food industry, with support from a very progressive union and some community organization, SEIU and some others, just basically saying, \"You know what? Let's just go for it. Because the progressive, smart people and pundits, they're saying we should ask for $10. We're going to $15.\" And then they did it.", "CHRIS HAYES: Right. I do remember how $15 was like, \"Oh, well why don't we just give every worker a Cadillac?\"", "DORIAN WARREN: Yeah, it was crazy, right? Then once they actually won in places, because at first when people, when they started going on strike, people were like, \"Oh, okay, this is like a public relations thing.\" Then they won in SeaTac and then Seattle and then San Francisco and now we're a couple of years in and the sky hasn't fallen. So it's totally shifted the conversation.", "CHRIS HAYES: What it did was they won, then it created a real world experiment, which created data, which again, to be open minded here, if it had actually tanked the economy, would have been a good lesson.", "DORIAN WARREN: That's right.", "CHRIS HAYES: I think we all agree that there is a level at which a minimum wage would begin to actually hurt an economy because that everybody in every job has to make $100 an hour in America, in 2019, you'd probably start to see some real dead weight effects, but what was amazing about that was they actually then the real world thing and then the data comes back and lo and behold, all the predictions of job loss didn't happen.", "DORIAN WARREN: Yes, that's right, and now there's a race to the top in the Democratic Party. If you're running for mayor or governor, and you basically have to be a record supporting $15.", "CHRIS HAYES: Yeah, that's true.", "DORIAN WARREN: The union part's dropped off, unfortunately, but you're, you got to be on record. But here's the more controversial point. I think the reason why we're seeing such boldness and audaciousness around transformational policy ideas is frankly, Trump. He busted the door open to not give like no craps, right?", "So like I think people on the left have learned, okay, well if he can just be out there with the white nationalists, white supremacists agenda and not only do it unabashedly and win, the electoral college at least, and then keep doubling down on it. What is stopping progressives, right?", "CHRIS HAYES: Right.", "DORIAN WARREN: Like, all right, let's just go for it.", "CHRIS HAYES: Right, if the taboos have been broken down on one side, break them down on the other.", "DORIAN WARREN: Exactly.", "CHRIS HAYES: I think that's a really-", "DORIAN WARREN: It doesn't have to be asymmetrical in terms of boldness around policy ideas.", "CHRIS HAYES: But the other part of it too is that I think there's this fear that I've seen set in among, again, kind of punted class, commentator class, but I think also political professionals that this will wrench the party out too far in really electorally toxic directions.", "One place I think you see this is on the issue of reparations which has become a sort of central issue and my feeling about reparations is that the moral substantive case is essentially rock solid. It is, like these people were injured at tremendous cost. The injury lasted through decades and decades and decades. The injury is real and cognizable under law. We should make reparations for it. That's distinct.", "There's lots of things that are right on the merits that are genuinely unpopular and, again, that changes over time, but I think fair to say, from the polling I've seen, not a super popular idea, particularly among white people. That's an example where, again, this push and pull of public opinion are you trying to change the temperature, take the temperature? I'm starting to see this conversation of fear that the kind of game theoretical dynamics of the primary are going to lead people who adopting positions that even if the right on the merits are going to end up being politically toxic.", "DORIAN WARREN: Yeah, but that's not new. That's every four years.", "CHRIS HAYES: Yeah. You're saying that fear is just an eternal fear?", "DORIAN WARREN: It's an eternal fear, and it depends on where you sit and how you see the political math. There is always a strategic choice and it's sometimes it's really hard choice. I'm not going to say this is easy. If you go, say, hard on racial justice or gender justice, the upside is you mobilize more people of color or more women and you might alienate, right, a certain percentage of those who don't see their identities included in that vision, right? So that's always the risk. I don't see enough of the pundits and the prognosticators, let's see the math, let's actually be a little rigorous.", "I think we saw some experiments, like this, and you can take away different lessons, but I think we saw this with Stacey Abrams, I think we saw this with Gillum in Florida and I think we saw it with Beto in Texas, up to an extent, of really going there. You might wonder in Georgia with Stacey Abrams who you had on this podcast a little while ago, which was amazing.", "CHRIS HAYES: It was a great podcast.", "DORIAN WARREN: Would she had gotten even that close if she wasn't as progressive?", "CHRIS HAYES: No, no.", "DORIAN WARREN: Right. I don't think so.", "CHRIS HAYES: No. I think Abrams is the best example just because her out performance of previous statewide Democratic candidates was so vast. So I agree with that. I think more of what I'm trying to get at is as you watched this coalition attempt to put together a pluralistic, vibrant coalition that feels connected to each other, it's exactly where we started this conversation when you're walking into a workplace and when you're doing your academic work on how do you construct an identity, in real time, collectively, among these different people coming from different places where they all feel included?", "DORIAN WARREN: Yes.", "CHRIS HAYES: But at the same time is cognizant of the fact that often the way those identities got constructed, center white men, center cis white men, are exclusionary and all kinds of ways like balancing those two things is really hard. I'm not sure I'm seeing that being done. I don't even know, maybe it's like a thing that you can do are just going to play out naturally? That's my big question.", "DORIAN WARREN: I think there's no easy answer here and I would especially be quick to add, there's no magic messaging.", "There's no magic set of words that's going to work. This is about deep organizational and institutional infrastructure and having those hard conversations and recruiting people to something over time, right? It can't just be two weeks before election day that the Democratic Party shows up in black communities and says to black people, \"Okay, now turn out.\" There has to be, and this is why I'm such forever a die hard labor movement person because we know if you put a working class white guy in a union, he will behave differently politically than he's if he's not. Part of that is because the union is the space, it's the institution, to build a sense of linked fate.", "Even if you don't, you don't have to agree with everything.", "CHRIS HAYES: Nope.", "DORIAN WARREN: But it's like doing that work day in and day out to provide a sense of shared and linked fate that my fate is somehow bound up with yours. We're not going to agree say on like 30% of the things, I might not agree on reparations, but I know my fate is still more tied to you than we might think of the corporate villains, for instance, whomever the villain is or the opponent is. That work takes a long time.", "CHRIS HAYES: It's not messaging.", "DORIAN WARREN: It can't just be like some magic messages. The best example I've seen of someone who can weave together a narrative, not a set of talking points, but a narrative around a broad social justice vision, I would go back to Jesse Jackson's '84 and '88 DNC convention speeches. Where he is literally telling you what the rainbow coalition is and he paints a picture where everyone can see themselves in it. It's actually one of the best pieces I think of American rhetoric to this day.", "I would argue Barack Obama didn't even do that, ever, in any of his campaigns because what Jackson does in '84 and '88 is he talks about the experiences of black people, but he weaves it into mosaic, right? This American quilt. He talks about white workers, he talks about farmers, he talks about gay people. He had this ability to, and again, it's a narrative, it wasn't a set of talking points. It wasn't. It was a story, right? It was a story people can see themselves in and it was a hopeful story, right? That gave people an aspiration to be their best selves.", "CHRIS HAYES: Well, Jamelle Bouie wrote it, actually wrote a great Slate column on exactly that. When people were having the sort of post Trump debate about is it economic anxiety? Is it racial grievance? He sort of talked about, look the way the Jesse Jackson actually a pretty good model for the way forward.", "I think one of the lessons to me in the political realm and one of the lessons of Jesse Jackson and I think Stacey Abrams and union organizing is you do have to show up. You cannot write people off.", "You can write some people off in that someone shows up and they're screaming, calling you an N-word, you don't have to go up there and try to try to break the law.", "DORIAN WARREN: Yeah, there's limits and boundaries, but yes.", "CHRIS HAYES: Generally, like places in the country, constituencies, you got to go to those places, you've got to make your case and Stacey Abrams, who again, part of the proof of concept there, and one of the first things she said in my conversation, she's like, \"I went everywhere and I talked to all kinds of people who I left that day knowing I didn't get any votes.\"", "DORIAN WARREN: That's right.", "CHRIS HAYES: \"But I was going to go there and talk to them because they're Georgians too and, it's my job to try to listen to what their problems are and maybe try to get them some healthcare, whether they voted for me or not.\" I think that ethos is just such an important one that can sit alongside with, let's not fetishize and completely center the mythical white working class voter who was Obama-Trump, who's the one totemic key to us persuading so that we can restore our majority.", "DORIAN WARREN: Let me throw this at you too because I think there's also a different kind of conversation we should be having about race. If you go back to W.E.B. Dubois, famous black activist, sociologist, who wrote this book, the definitive book on black reconstruction, the reconstruction period in America. He had this thing about the psychological wage of whiteness of which then came another book called The Wages of Whiteness, which basically argues, right, that white working class people have this. The thing that substituted for being a wage earner for being a worker and being exploited was whiteness.", "I think what's happened in the last 30 years is not just wage stagnation but white wage stagnation, right? There's like this declining value of whiteness that has been happening and that's the real thing underneath all the racial resentment, Trump voters. There's a way in which the loss of privilege feels like harm.", "I just want someone to say that, right? I bet you a whole bunch of, you know, white working class folks actually want people just to say that and then say, \"Okay, but here's the vision of how your fate is actually linked to these people that don't look like you. But like here is a different vision of how like we can all rise too.\" And I'm not doing it well.", "CHRIS HAYES: No, that's a great, because I mean, what you're seeing is you're, you're kind of like giving a woke re-characterization of the \u201cyou can't see anything anymore.\u201d There's so much discrimination against white people these days, which is the reactionary vision that Trump feeds and we know from Michael Tesler work. He's been on the show is, the basically are white people discriminated against as a polling question is your best predictor of a Trump voter?", "You saying the whiteness wage premium it was not a material benefit but a psychological benefit that was conferred on you because you saw yourself centered in all stories. Everything was marketed to you. You had an inherent superiority that was conferred on you as a white man, particularly from every single direction. So even if your job was shitty and even if you are not making a lot of money like in the domicile of your home you ruled, in the kind of national imagination you were at the center. All that stuff confers real, tangible psychological benefits, even if they don't show up in your bank account.", "DORIAN WARREN: That's right.", "CHRIS HAYES: Those have been reduced over time, which feels like you have lost.", "DORIAN WARREN: Well it's both. It is actual wage stagnation and the stagnation of the psychological wage. I just think if we don't give people a story, they will make one up. I am not the person that's saying we need to center the white working class and everything we do. I'm not saying that, but we need at least to offer a story that can acknowledge like, yeah, when people are privileged-", "CHRIS HAYES: I hear you.", "DORIAN WARREN: ... and when they lose privilege, it actually feels like crap, right? It feels like shit. So let's like say it and then offer an alternative vision, right?", "CHRIS HAYES: Dude, here I am, I am as lucky and privileged as a human being can be on the earth of 2019 almost. I mean, you know, it's a rounding error, those above me, right? In the relative scheme of things, anyone who has more privilege than me. If someone like calls me out for something on Twitter, I'm like, oh, this is, I cannot. That feeling there is just a real visceral feeling. Oftentimes you work your way to being like you know, that maybe that's, they were right on that. But the feeling is real.", "People that have way, way, way, way, way, way, way less privilege than I do, even if they do have some of the same privileges I do, as straight white men moving around of America, finding some progressive left liberal way to talk about that. That isn't just the reductive economic argument, which I think is part of the problem too.", "DORIAN WARREN: Yes, that's right.", "CHRIS HAYES: Because just to be like, well it's your wages. That's actually that's actually not getting at the thing.", "DORIAN WARREN: No, it's much more than that. It's America. It's never been just about wages.", "CHRIS HAYES: That's totally right. That's what makes us different. So are you hopeful right now? Are you feeling, what's your feeling about where we're at as this process starts to gear up that is increasingly ... You and I were talking the other night at a social function and you know, the people that I am in kind of constant back and forth with, who work in all different spheres, in different industries, in different parts of politics or you know, public defenders. There's a certain point at which the campaign starts to just colonize every conversation, which we're heading into. Where are you feeling as we head into that?", "DORIAN WARREN: I am feeling like I'm a walking contradiction. I'll just say it like that. Right? I'm terrified every day of what will happen in 2020. Before Michael Cohen said it, I was saying that even if the president lost, he wouldn't leave office, right? We have to plan for that. What's our scenario planning around that possibility? So I'm partly terrified, but I'm mostly super hopeful because I do feel, and the people I talk to every day what I'm seeing and hearing, we are on the verge of a transformational moment. I do think that we have to act like that. We have to believe it and we have to therefore prepare for it.", "We're seeing some of it in terms of the ideas, but what do we have to do now? Let's say we have a huge realignment in the electorate in 2020 and progressives sweep. Can we actually plan now for the backlash that will come in 2022? Can we like do that thought experiment because it's going to, that's how America works.", "So let's get out ahead of it for once and think about, okay, if we have a transformational moment, how do we make 2020 like 1932 in a sense, right? Where it ushered in a period, in great economic crisis by the way, but it ushered in a period of incredibly bold new ideas and policy implementation. This thing called the New Deal, which is why we can still refer to it now when we say Green New Deal, right?", "CHRIS HAYES: Right.", "DORIAN WARREN: Because it's still resonant, you know, almost a hundred years later, which is kinda crazy if you think about it.

In the book, West \u2014 an outspoken feminist woman who refuses to apologize for being fat \u2014 shares stories of being shamed for her body and learning to truly love it, of the harassment women face purely for having an opinion online and, touchingly, of how she managed to fall in love, get married and find the happiness to which fat women are too often told they do not deserve access.", "Three years later, \"Shrill\" has been reborn as a series on Hulu, which repackages and retells West\u2019s story through the character of Annie Easton, an aspiring Portland-based writer who spends the series' six episodes accepting herself, standing up for what she believes in and navigating the complex minefield that is sex, dating and relationships in your twenties.", "Since its debut, \"Shrill\" has earned effusive praise for its honest and sympathetic portrayal of modern womanhood, with fans highlighting its racially diverse cast and commitment to celebrating bodies of all shapes and sizes. For instance, in the fourth episode, \u201cPool,\u201d Annie attends an event called the Fat Babe Pool Party with her roommate and best friend. The sea of scantily clad fat women whose bodies are lovingly filmed as they joyfully and unapologetically have fun in the sun has been held up as the epitome of \"Shrill\u2019s\" commitment to doing things differently from most of what we see on TV.", "But its radical commitment to body positivity and diversity isn\u2019t the only thing that separates \"Shrill\" from other woman-centric offerings. In the decades since \"Sex and the City\"made it okay for women to talk about oral sex on TV, a number of shows have promised to give audiences an honest, unflinching look at the sex lives of young women. HBO\u2019s \"Girls\" drew attention for its willingness to showcase dirty talk and sex acts that even \"Sex and the City\u2019s\" Samantha would have found unthinkable.

The show\u2019s boldness comes not from any propensity to venture into something unfamiliar to the intended audience, but from a willingness to honestly depict the mundanity of sex in your twenties and the common choices women face around it.", "\"Shrill\u2019s\" honesty also extends to its warts-and-all depiction of dating, in which women are allowed to make bad choices without inviting the audience's negative judgment \u2014 and where those bad choices aren\u2019t sugar-coated or used to set up an unrealistic, deus ex machina style romantic storyline.", "At the beginning of the series, for example, Annie is dating Ryan, an unambitious deadbeat dad who\u2019s mostly interested in getting high, having fun and recording an unlistenable podcast with his friends.

{"headline": ["Dying of whiteness with Jonathan Metzl: podcast & transcript"], "content": ["**This conversation explores death by suicide and gun violence**", "JONATHAN METZL: Because Tennessee didn't do the expansion, that cost every white citizen in the state two to three weeks of life, just because of this ideology. And it's ironic that the people I interviewed for the book, who were the staunchest supporters of blocking Obamacare and telling me about the \u201cwitch doctor Obamacare,\u201d all these kind of things, those were the same people who were giving away three weeks of their life in support of these politics, and voting for people who did so.", "CHRIS HAYES: Hello, and welcome to \"Why Is This Happening,\" with me your host, Chris Hayes. So, when do you think the last time that life expectancy in the United States fell for three years in a row? Think about that for a second. Life expectancy is one of those just sort of gold standard indicators of the progress of a society, along with things like material wealth or per capita GDP. One of the things that happens, societies, they get wealthier, they grow and people live longer. And the reason people live longer is because the healthcare system gets better, diseases that kill people at young ages start to get knocked out, things like malaria for instance, which is still a huge battle in huge parts of the global south.", "Things like maternal and infant mortality get better. Right? Like these are all the signs of progress. A progressing society is one in which people are living longer. And the reason they're living longer is because the society is getting richer and the healthcare is getting better and everything's going good, right? Pointed in the right direction. And that's generally true. The U.S. has a lower life expectancy than a lot of the other OECD countries, but much, much higher than what we call developing countries. Say, a place like Mozambique or Indonesia, right?", "Now, when you see a society that starts having life expectancy go down, something is happening. Something's up. That's a distress signal from that society. An example of a place where life expectancy started to go down was Russia right after the fall of the Soviet Union. This sort of collapse period in which all sorts of societal institutions were coming apart. And you saw a big spike in all kinds of deaths, things like suicide and alcoholism, things like that.", "In the U.S., the last time that life expectancy went down three years in a row was 1915 to 1918. And what was happening then were two things, World War I and the global flu pandemic that killed 50 million people, including 650,000 Americans.", "Right? So, maybe you know this history, maybe you don't. You've got the World War, and what happens is in the war all these people around each other who transmit a flu then they all come back home at the end of the war, where they then take that flu, transmit it into the host countries, and across the globe 50 million people die from the global flu pandemic. 650,000 die in the U.S., and the global flu pandemic and the deaths from the war itself mean that US life expectancy goes down from 1915 to 1980.", "That's the only time that U.S. life expectancy went down until 2015, 2016, 2017. Think about that for a second. Economic recovery is in full swing. Maybe if you saw those numbers in 2008, 2009, you would think, okay, huge Great Recession, people are out of work. Maybe they don't have access to health care. Maybe there's a surge in things like suicides. No. Life expectancy kept bumping along, progressing. Three years in a row, 2015, 2016, 2017. That is a wild, wild statistical artifact. It doesn't make any sense.", "It should not be happening. A rich developing society that is not in the midst of some obvious crisis like a global flu pandemic or the end of a World War should not be seeing life expectancy decline for three years in a row. It should not be happening. There isn't a very good precedent for it. And yet, that is what's happening in the United States of America.", "So, back in 2015, two Princeton professors, Anne Case and Angus Deaton, wrote a study of midlife mortality for white people, particularly white people without a college degree, and they found it was going way up. In fact, it had been better than African-Americans, and was now 30 percent worse in some cases. Again, what was driving this, what they call deaths of despair, alcohol-induced death, suicide, and particularly opioid overdoses. Something is happening in America, and particularly among white America, that is driving the effect we are seeing of lower life expectancy. And it is a genuine social mystery.", "Because when you zoom out, all the macro indicators say this should not be happening and it is happening, and it is particularly notable that is happening so intensely among white Americans. We know forever that there have been massive health disparities in America by class, socioeconomic status, and particularly race, and it is still the case. Life expectancy in America is lower for African-Americans than white people. All those health disparities are there, but they've been converging a little bit and they've been converging because white health is getting worse.", "So, what is the answer? What does it mean? What is driving us? My guest today has a theory. Just a heads up, in this conversation we do talk a lot about suicide and gun violence. If those are issues that have a particularly intense effect on you, you just should know that before you go in.", "Jonathan Metzl is a psychiatrist and sociologist. He runs a center at Vanderbilt University. And he just wrote a book called ", "And his theory is that a certain kind of politics of whiteness, a politics of whiteness that leads people to elect political leaders that pass certain policies, is actually driving the negative health effects on white people themselves. People are basically taking years off their lives by the people they vote for, who promise to protect their position in the social hierarchy. That's the theory behind the case.", "And if you listened last week to the conversation with Dorian Warren, where he talked about that W.E.B. Dubois idea of the mental wage of whiteness, right? The way the intangible benefit that whiteness confers on a person. And then, the wage stagnation that's happened. Right? Not just the actual real material wage stagnation, but the sort of psychological wage stagnation as a society grows ever more equal, as white people are no longer quite as centered as they once were in the national story.", "This conversation is like a Google map zoom in on that core idea. What is happening among a certain strata of white Americans, particularly rural white Americans, conservative white Americans, who feel under threat. And this feeling of threat is intimately bound to their whiteness, and who pursue a politics to preserve that whiteness and the status of it, that produces social artifacts that lead to their deaths. That is the thesis of Jonathan Metzl's book and it's the grim tragic loop that much of the country right now is caught in. To unlock the mystery of those statistics about life expectancy I told you about, but also understand a lot about what's driving politics in certain parts of the country. You're gonna want to listen to Jonathan Metzl.", "CHRIS HAYES: You've practiced as a doctor?", "JONATHAN METZL: I trained as a psychiatrist. I went all the way through and then I got interested in issues of politics and race and social context. And so, I ended up going back to school to get a PhD in critical race theory and American history. And I've been trying to combine those two over the course of my career.", "CHRIS HAYES: That's really interesting. What made you want to do that?", "JONATHAN METZL: You know, it's great to do medical training. I learned a lot about illness and treatment and medical systems. But there were so many issues that were coming up in my medical training that we couldn't address. Initially, it was that people were coming in with disorders that were linked to poverty or because they couldn't get food, because they couldn't get medication. They couldn't get transit to the hospital. And even though the doctors tried to be sympathetic or empathetic, it turned out that those answers to those questions had to do with much bigger forces, like economy, food distribution systems, structural racism, oppression, history. And so, I wanted to be able to tell the other side of that story. So, I ended up going back to school to try to do that.", "CHRIS HAYES: It's so funny, because we had a guy named Abdul El-Sayed on the podcast. Really fascinating guy. He ran for governor of Michigan, but he's a Rhodes Scholar and then was a clinician, and then left that to get his doctorate in public health, taught at Columbia, who basically told a very similar story, right? That he was like seeing patients and what he was encountering was the things that were making the ill were essentially result of social structures that were making them sick.", "JONATHAN METZL: We started a new movement through my program and some other places called structural competency, and the basic idea is exactly that. Namely, that doctors are taught to be sympathetic, to be racially sensitive. All those things are important. But if somebody's coming in with a disorder that's caused by racism or poverty, you actually need to understand the upstream factors in addition to the clinical factors. And it's good to see medicine broadening its focus.", "CHRIS HAYES: Really, there are people trying to teach that to medical students?", "JONATHAN METZL: We started a movement and there's now a movement called the structural competency movement. And basically the argument is medicine by itself is not enough. It's great to be a great doctor. But if you really want to help people in this context, you actually have to ally with urban planners, with community organizations, people who understand how to get food out in the middle of food deserts. So, we've got I think 20 medical schools now teaching our materials.", "CHRIS HAYES: Where do you come from? How do you get your politics?", "JONATHAN METZL: My politics in part are what I write about in the book. I'm somebody who my father is a Holocaust survivor. He escaped Austria. My grandparents were displaced persons in Switzerland. It took them about 10 years to get into this country. When they got to the United States, we were located, my father and my grandparents, in Kansas City. We started off cleaning homes, then opening a bodega, opening a meat shop, a kosher meat shop.", "CHRIS HAYES: I just want to be clear. They don't call it a bodega in Kansas City.", "JONATHAN METZL: Yeah. I have to say-", "CHRIS HAYES: This is the New Yorker in you retconning \"bodega\" back in Kansas-", "JONATHAN METZL: My mom is from Queens. My mom's from Kew Gardens, and so we had to call it a bodega.", "CHRIS HAYES: You got it. Tiffany at one point to me ... We had one conversation on the podcast where I said the bodega, she's like, \"I don't know if people know what a bodega is.\"", "JONATHAN METZL: No, Philly, Baltimore, they don't have bodegas. Chicago doesn't have a bodega, but I'm telling you, if you're not going to call our thing a bodega, you'll have to take that up with my mom.", "CHRIS HAYES: Okay.", "JONATHAN METZL: So basically, and everybody who bought kosher meat at the store had to put a dollar into the jar to send my father to medical school. My dad went to med school. He came to New York. He met my mom. My dad's very patriotic. He joined the Air Force, stationed in Turkey. I was born there on an Air Force base, and then we all moved back to Kansas City.", "JONATHAN METZL: And so, we were from Kansas City, Missouri, and very proud, but we were also people who escaped a war zone and people who had known government oppression and anti-Semitism. And so, it was this kind of combination of feeling strongly about the region we were living in but also knowing that there was a bigger world out there that could impinge on that at any time.", "CHRIS HAYES: Missouri is a really interesting state. It's where the book starts. It's where your first sort of study is. The book is called \"Dying of Whiteness.\" What was the seed for this book? How did you start on this?", "JONATHAN METZL: The seed was twofold. First, it was based on my growing up experiences in a way. I grew up in a Kansas City where people had very different ideologies, very different backgrounds.", "I had a lot of friends who are Republican, Democrat, pro-gun, anti-gun, everything imaginable. And in the Kansas City that I grew up in, we found a way to make it work. And I can give you many examples of that. All of the camps we went to, the schools. There was a push for integration, diversity.", "Of course, there was also a strong history of racism and oppression in Missouri, but I would say when I was in high school, the state senate was really evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. And so, they devised a power-sharing agreement where every year the chairmanship would flip back and forth between Democrat and Republican.", "So, people were different and we knew it and we found a way to get along. And then, over the course of ... as I moved away from Missouri and every six months I go back to visit my parents, and it felt like every six months or so some pillar of that kind of neighborliness ended up getting chipped away.", "So, first it was you need guns to protect yourself and people started getting on edge about that. We need tax cuts that were going to eviscerate the roads, bridges, and schools, and parks that we all use. And all of a sudden, this neighborliness was replaced with a kind of tension. I feel very sensitive to that. So, I think that-", "CHRIS HAYES: You felt that palpably in sort of going back.", "JONATHAN METZL: A 100 percent, a 100 percent. I mean, let me give you one example. When I was doing my research for the book, I went and talked to people across Kansas City and in the suburbs about what it meant to see people carrying firearms around in public spaces, and I talked to a number of African-Americans. I'll never forget there was one guy named John who I spoke to. I'm changing all the names, but he said he used to love shopping at Sam's Club because that was where he got the best discounts for his home goods and things. And then, he started seeing white guys walking through the aisles carrying open and concealed carry weapons, and he found it to be a form of racial intimidation.", "JONATHAN METZL: And he said he and members of his family, he forbid people he knew and his family members from going to Sam's Club because he felt like the people who were open carrying were doing it to intimidate people like him.", "CHRIS HAYES: Wow.", "JONATHAN METZL: In the book, I have a number of cases like that, where basically the minute you change things that are the social fabric of society, all of a sudden people start to mistrust each other more. And so, I would say yes, it was based on a general sense. But when I started to do the research for the book, all of a sudden this idea of neighborliness was replaced with this concern, which maybe was subterranean the entire time, but this concern that someone else is going to rip me off.", "And so, when I talk to struggling working class white people, who were brave and courageous in many ways, but this concern that minorities and immigrants are going to take privileges or resources that are mine. It was almost like because of the policies, people were set to mistrust each other. And I guess I just spent a lot of time thinking about yeah, we can track, like I do in the book, death or illness or politics, Twitter, all these big things, but on the every day level, what does it mean for people's social interaction to put a lot of guns in society and to reject health care reform so that everybody's scrambling for healthcare resources? To cut away the tax base so that working-class people, all of a sudden, their schools suck?", "And really what I found was the minute that becomes the economy, this sense of mistrust and anxiety really ratchets up and people end up becoming much more balkanized and much less neighborly.", "CHRIS HAYES: There's a public health phenomenon that is at the core of this book, right? So, you're sort of writing about ... you\u2019re kind of theorizing around the data. Right? And the data has gotten some headlines and it's about what's happening to Americans' health, particularly white Americans' health. And we should note, there are massive health disparities in America, racially and along class and educational and income lines. But if you just zoom in on white people, something really weird has been happening.", "JONATHAN METZL: That's exactly right.", "CHRIS HAYES: To them in terms of mortality and morbidity. What is happening? What's the data saying?", "JONATHAN METZL: Part of this book, that's exactly right, is a data book. I did a bunch of deep dives into databases, that track injury and death and longevity and other factors. It turns out, if you're a white American and you live in a state that, for example, allows the free flow of firearms, that rejected Obamacare and rejected a Medicaid expansion basically, or did these massive tax cuts, that the actual policies, the policies that were supposed to make white America great again are as dangerous to your health as are asbestos or not wearing a seatbelt or secondhand smoke. They literally became disease risk factors that shortened life.", "And I have some of the numbers here. For example, Missouri. Missouri was a state that it was quite hard to get a permit. People did it, but it wasn't like anybody could go get a gun. As it became easier and easier and easier for people to get guns, the rates of death and injury went up in many populations. But the one I track most dramatically was white male suicide. And just over the five years that they did away with the permit laws in Missouri, white male suicide ended up costing the state $300 million. It cost 11,000 white male life years.", "So, I'm using databases to track this, but the numbers are exponential. And I track it all back to these particular policies. Similarly in Tennessee, I compare Tennessee and Kentucky. One state did the expansion, the other state didn't do the expansion.", "CHRIS HAYES: For Medicaid under the Obamacare?", "JONATHAN METZL: Exactly. That's exactly right. And because Tennessee didn't do the expansion, that cost every white citizen in the state two to three weeks of life, just because of this ideology, and the reason-", "CHRIS HAYES: Just non-expansion.", "JONATHAN METZL: Just non-expansion. And the reason that is, is because ... and it wasn't just poor people, working class people. It was an aggregate number. And the reason that is, it makes sense if you think about it. It's that if there is no health base, if there's no safety net, what happens is people start going to the emergency rooms and they're sicker when they go to the emergency rooms. It drains resources from the system.", "And so, all of these resources that should be spread throughout the system end up getting drained down to the bottom and the entire health care system suffers. And so again, it's worse if you're working class or poor person. It's definitely worse if you're a minority or immigrant, but it's ironic that the people I interviewed for the book who were the staunchest supporters of blocking Obamacare and telling me about the \u201cwitch doctor Obamacare,\u201d all these kind of things, those were the same people who were giving away three weeks of their life in support of these politics, and voting for people who did so.", "CHRIS HAYES: The stuff about guns was really striking to me, because when we talk about guns in America, there's two things that we talk about. We tend to talk about mass shootings, which get a lot of attention understandably, but are relatively statistically rare, people shooting 10 or 12 people in a school for instance, like happened in Parkland. And then, we talk about urban violence, right? And urban violence is always very racially coded. And it is true that there are higher rates of violence in places like Cleveland, Baltimore, Chicago.", "The thing we don't talk about is the thing that kills most people, by far. I mean, three to one, right? Something like that, a year? Which is suicide. And one of the things you write in the book is that when you're looking at the data that is showing life expectancy in America declining among white populations, one big part of the driver is suicide.", "JONATHAN METZL: One of the most powerful parts of the book and really of the research and really of my entire career was the research I did in Missouri for this book. I went through southern parts of Missouri, very red state Missouri, very pro-gun Missouri, and I was honored that people let me into their homes. They let me into their families. And they let me into their support groups. And the support groups that I sat in on were support groups for people who had lost often children or husbands or wives or parents to gun suicide, and the pain in the room was immeasurable. Immeasurable. Just so much concern and so much fear and loss.", "And part of that was of course to lose someone by suicide doesn't make sense in any context, but the other part of the story was that these were very pro-gun people who had believed so deeply that guns were their protectors. That gun was the thing that was going to stop a bad guy and all these kind of things. And so, they were kind of coming to terms with how is it that this thing that was supposed to protect me that I carry with me all the time ended up costing me the person that I cared most about in my life. And it was immensely, immensely powerful and sad, but also meaningful to talk to people and really ask them that question.", "And when I would ask them, \"Did this change the way you felt about guns?\" I learned actually that was the wrong question, because they would always say it's not the gun's fault. But what I would ask them, \"What can we do to protect and keep people say within pro-gun communities?\" They would always say, \"Something really needs to be done. We need to do something about this.\" But there was no logic for them. In other words, the polarization was so intense that they couldn't take a stance that was against the NRA. They were striving for some kind of story, and so just an answer to your question, this gun suicide story was so hard because there was no ready-made cultural language for people to process what was happening exactly.", "CHRIS HAYES: One of the things we know about suicide, and I think I understand people's inclination to say, \"It wasn't the gun. That was just the tool that they used.\" But one of the things that data show us about suicide is actually opportunity matters a tremendous amount, right? I mean, if you stop someone or people that fail when they attempt to commit suicide, there's actually very low rates of repeat attempts, and people go on to have fulfilling lives.", "JONATHAN METZL: The numbers on gun suicide bare that out 100 percent. In other words, I'm a psychiatrist, right? People always say, \"Oh, was it a cry for help? What were the warning signs?\" But gun suicide has its own temporality, it's own linearity. Very often gun suicide, numerically, is what's called an impulsive act. People will decide within 59 minutes or less. It's not like they've seen a psychiatrist or have a long history of mental illness. The typical story that I heard, and I think people see, are he was really drunk. He got fired. He found out his wife was having an affair. Something like that. Like this moment of total despair, and then there's a gun available. And the sad truth is that the same guns that people want not locked up in safes because they're there to protect you, in those 59 minutes or less, that is the biggest risk factor in mortality because it's not like they're any more or less suicide attempts across the country, across the world. But gun suicide is lethal 96 percent of the time. Whereas overdose, which is the most common global way to attempt suicide, it's lethal about three to four percent of the time. And so here's this toxic mix of available guns, a moment of despair, and at that one moment, you have access to an incredibly efficient way to end your own life, and at that moment, it's not a mental health issue.", "So when I talk to psychiatrists-", "CHRIS HAYES: It's an availability.", "JONATHAN METZL: It's an availability issue. And that's why when people ask me, \"What can psychiatrists do about gun suicide?\" And I said, \"It's not about prediction. You can't predict who's going to do this. It's about prevention. You don't want a gun there at that moment.\"", "CHRIS HAYES: You write about this in the book, gun suicide is a distinct thing in the category of suicide in terms of how people undertake it, the impulsivity of it, and ultimately the lethality. And is there a connection? Gun deaths have now surpassed I think for the first time auto deaths, and the bulk of that is suicides. What is driving those numbers?", "JONATHAN METZL: Right. So in terms of gun suicide, again, I'm a mental health practitioner and people say, \"was there a disorder of somebody's brain? Was it something about the despair?\" I'm sure it was all of those things. I'm sure it was all of the above very often. But gun suicide tracks onto laws about how people buy, store, and carry firearms. So in the book, I compare Missouri and Connecticut, and I just show here's one state that did one thing with its laws, and here's another state that did another thing with its laws. And Connecticut making it hard for people to get guns and also enacting the kind of laws that would take guns away from people who are at high risk, lead to dramatic decreases in gun suicide. Whereas Missouri, where it was just almost a free for all in a way, people in critical race studies say whiteness is invisible, and what that means is we don't talk about whiteness because it's the authority. But here, in this case, I was seeing that this plague of white suffering was invisible. Because we couldn't talk about whiteness, we couldn't talk about the fact that white people were dying because of these tools that were supposed to be markers of their own power.", "CHRIS HAYES: There's just something so tragic and intense about the notion of this sort of fear mongering about the other, about the home invader, about the evening news while you live in the distant St. Louis suburbs and the notion of a black assailant coming to the door, and the need to buy a gun to protect against that, and that gun being there at your moment of utmost despair leading to a lethal suicide.", "JONATHAN METZL: It made me so upset. I mean, I'm an objective researcher, and I try to be neutral. I replayed a lot of the interviews verbatim in the book, and a couple of them were from people who lived right outside of St. Louis who were elderly white men who ended up, because Ferguson was happening, they all ran out and got weapons because, as you say, 200 miles away, there was some racial unrest happening or some factors like that. So this idea of the racial other, it's so irresponsible, but it's something that wasn't just based in the news. I mean, the NRA was saying, \"get a gun because there's a carjacker or a gang banger, and they might attack you. That's why you need a gun.\" I look at a lot of gun advertisements and this idea of basically they market them to white males saying, \"these are symbols of your power, your privilege, restoring the balance of power.\" And I didn't see anything that was like, \"be careful in your moments of despair. This is a lethal tool. This can kill you or anything like that.\"", "So we've seen in this country that that ties into a larger story, which is just the reasons people own guns in this country, have undergone a dramatic shift over the past 20 years in large part because of these exact stories. 15 years ago, people, the majority felt like they needed guns for hunting. Now that's about 20 percent of gun owners. Everybody else feels like they need a gun now for protection, and the minute that happens, we're fearing each other.", "CHRIS HAYES: And the crazy thing about that is that has switched at the time that crime in an objective sense has fallen in an unprecedented fashion.", "JONATHAN METZL: Exactly right. Basically people have never been more safe from a statistical angle. And so this whipping up of fear of other people is part of the story, and the other part, going back to your question before, is about automobiles, right? I mean, people who I talk to, I talk to a lot of pro-gun and anti-gun and everybody in between audiences, and people will tell me, \"Well, guns are in the Constitution and cars are not, and that's why they're different stories.\" But I don't buy that for a second. In the mid-1990s, we had about 40,000 car deaths a year in the United States, and we felt as a society that that number was too high. So we didn't go take away everybody's car. What we did is we invented anti-lock brakes, we invented airbags, we made safer cars, smarter cars.", "CHRIS HAYES: We also had a tremendously important and socially transformative movement against drunk driving.", "JONATHAN METZL: Exactly right.", "CHRIS HAYES: Which completely altered behavioral norms. I mean, this is a matter of the data.", "JONATHAN METZL: 100 percent right. So in other words, I think all these things, what they say together, is that we as a society decided, not Republican or Democrat, we decided that these were too many deaths. And so what happened was we did what we do best as Americans, we got together, and we figured out a hard problem, and now car deaths are probably half of what they were in the 1990s.", "CHRIS HAYES: Amazing.", "JONATHAN METZL: The numbers are exactly opposite for guns. The gun deaths now are nearing 40,000, probably more than that, and so it's exactly the opposite story. And that story is one, as you say, a lack of political will; a messaging that polarizes people, that makes it hard for them to ... I mean, I really feel like these polarizing messages make people feel like it's impossible to find common ground when these are problems we can be solving.", "CHRIS HAYES: Okay. So that's all based on data around gun suicides, but there's another driver in the dying of whiteness that really stands out or stood out to me, and let's get to that in just a minute.", "So guns are one area that's driving this increased mortality, particularly gun suicides. I want to be specific on that because what's happening in the context of non-white communities, communities of color, particularly poor communities of color is just a very different story. Although, obviously, gun suicides happen there as well, but that's not the driver in the way that it is in the rural Missouri you're talking about. There's also the other thing that we're seeing is opioid addiction and alcohol addiction actually. I think one of the interesting things you talk about and one of the things that got a little buried when the sort of Angus Eaton paper came out talking about what's going on with this mortality rate for white people is that alcohol had a lot to play with it, which is an interesting part of the story because I think we think about the opioid crisis as a crisis of the drug and the chemicals, and the fact that alcohol deaths are going up too says that there's something maybe else going on.", "JONATHAN METZL: I struggle with this data. I mean, I know it's there. I know it's important. I know that it's remarkable that we're seeing up to a four year decrease lifespan for people who are in the majority group in this country. White men are having a falling lifespan in part of the country, which is unheard of.", "CHRIS HAYES: It's just that doesn't happen.", "JONATHAN METZL: It happens after famines, it happens after atomic bombs. It doesn't happen in the middle of a prosperous country that's an industrialized country. So it's completely unheard of.", "CHRIS HAYES: Am I correct that overall, across all races and everything, American lifespan has declined for three years in a row?", "JONATHAN METZL: That is true, but it's particularly ... I mean, yes, that's definitely true. But I feel like white men are major drivers of this, in part because they have a higher perch to fall from in a particular way, but again, we have the money and the means and the resources. And part of what I show ... I mean, the reason I say I struggle with calling these deaths of despair, they are deaths of despair, and obviously what I'm trying to do in my book is put a racial lens around a lot of that economic literature to say it's not just about drugs, it's about the ways that whiteness itself can be very self-destructive. And so it's a performance of whiteness that is leading to people supporting these politics, these policies. So it's this interplay. I know, believe me, I know there is despair. I've seen it. In a way Trump has seen it and he speaks to that, and there is a lot of despair. People feel like they were in a position of privilege, whatever. I might think of it. Of course, I'm a white person as well.", "But there is a sense of frustration and helplessness, and I think the opioid crisis is part about despair. But the point I try to make in the book is it's also about social policy. It's also about policies. It's also about infrastructure. It's about investing not just in treatment and rehab centers but also in jobs and roads and bridges and schools.", "CHRIS HAYES: So the statistical thing that is happening in this country right now doesn't have a good precedent and doesn't make a lot of sense.", "JONATHAN METZL: I mean, there really is no precedent for what we're seeing, and the irony is the people who are being the most affected it by it are the ones who are voting for it.", "CHRIS HAYES: And so this is where the theorization of dying of whiteness comes in I think in a really fascinating way, right? Because I think the theorization that we had seen before had a lot to do with the sort of forgotten places, the hollowing out of rural America, big macro-economic and globalized trends that were ripping communities apart in ways that were creating behaviors that were dangerous from a health perspective and also psychological conditions that were dangerous, right? Increased levels of depression, anxiety, despair.", "You're saying something that is related to that but distinct, right? Because you're theorizing in it in a particular way around race.", "JONATHAN METZL: Right.", "CHRIS HAYES: How?", "JONATHAN METZL: There are a couple of ways to address that. Let me just first start with what I think the main point about race is, it's that the politics that claim to restore or bolster whiteness end up turning whiteness itself into a high risk category. That the categories that are supposed to make whiteness great again end up, as we've been talking about, shortening the lifespans of working class white Americans, and whiteness itself becomes a negative health indicator in the data that I look at. And that ties into several things. One is profoundly effective messaging that working class white Americans should not form common cause with other people across socioeconomic lines. In other words, the messaging is you should mistrust African-Americans or immigrants because if you allied with those workers, that might form a very powerful force to demand concessions. So there's this idea of whiteness itself is distinct, and it's played to through the history of guns, for example. History of guns, there's been a 200-year history in this country that gun ownership was a white prerogative, and that rejection of the Affordable Care Act ties into these long histories that if you give healthcare to everybody, then your population is going to suffer. Tax cuts, this idea that lazy minorities are going to be getting what's yours.", "And so there's been this profound messaging that basically has people caught. If you think about like the white working and middle class, they're caught between immigrants and minorities who are supposed to be nipping at their heels for what they want, and people above, who really are taking away the tax base that's helping them, and all of the energy in all of this is telling people, \"You should look down at the people who are nipping at your heels, not up at actually the people who might really be causing what's screwing up you screwing up your life.\"", "JONATHAN METZL: After writing the book, I've been asked a lot by people who probably in New York more than anyplace. They're saying, \"What'll it take for people to recognize that their politics are bad for them? What's it going to take for them to wake up?\" Or something like that. And I keep thinking, \"Well, from their perspective, they're making a sacrifice in order to win an election, right?\u201d So from their perspective, why are you going to be the person who asks that question when, for them, we get to choose all the judges. We won the elections, factors like that. So there is this mortal trade off. But the flip side of this that I try to get at in the book is that that trade off is also necessary for the GOP platform. In other words, if working class white Americans are not willing to lay down on the tracks.", "Imagine, for example, if people in Tennessee had said, \"Well, I'm a Republican, but dang, I want good healthcare,\" or, \u201cI'm in Kansas,\u201d another place I go in the book, \u201cand I'm a Republican, but I demand that we have good schools and we have good roads.\u201d The minute that people who are Conservative Republicans start asking for those things, there's no way the GOP can do the tax cut bill. There's no way that they repeal Obamacare initiatives or any of that. None of that works. And so part of what I argue is that the success of GOP politics at this one moment depends on assumptions about the disposability of working class white bodies and that this is also been a story that's been a very regional story, right? That's one of the things that's important now that in a way it was easy for people in New York to overlook it because that was what was happening in Mississippi, and now this is a national platform.", "CHRIS HAYES: But here's the thing that I think is really important. I mean, the ways in which you get sort of white middle class people to sort of ignore their class interests and have solidarity with the titans in Capitol, right? Again, this is an old story. But what ends up happening in the analysis is that people take the material concerns as real, and the non-material concerns is like weird or like a swindle or a con. And so they think, \"Well, these people are misassessing their own interests.\" And one of the things I think that you say in the book, you started with this guy Trevor I think, right?", "JONATHAN METZL: Right.", "CHRIS HAYES: Who is someone who is a sort of working class white guy with health problems who doesn't care if expanding Obamacare would help him personally. He doesn't want Obamacare to be expanded because other people, people of color particularly, will then get benefits. He's actually making an affirmative choice about what's more important to him. I mean, this is the important thing. It's not that people are tricked.", "JONATHAN METZL: Right.", "CHRIS HAYES: Like they actually have an ... Like whiteness, the value of whiteness is actually more important. They're making an affirmative choice about what the thing is, the thing they like, they value that gives them a sense of well being more than like having healthcare.", "JONATHAN METZL: The flip side of the question of when are Trump supporters going to wake up is when are people who are liberal going to wake up themselves to the depth of these ideologies that people are willing to put their lives on the line. That case of Trevor is a perfect example. This was a focus group I was doing in a low income community in Tennessee and this guy was on death's doorstep, had an oxygen mask under his nose, had liver failure, and even at that time, I asked him, \"Gosh, if you live 20 minutes away in Kentucky, you would get much cheaper medications and better healthcare because they adopted the marketplace and expanded Medicaid.\" And he said, \"I don't want any part of that because I don't want my tax dollars going to Mexicans and welfare queens.\" The guy wasn't crazy. He was basically saying, \"Here's a choice I'm making, that I'm a kamikaze in a way. I'm laying down on a line for something that's important to me, and that thing is an ideology, a construction of whiteness where I might not be at the top of the pyramid, but I'm certainly not at the bottom.\" And in a way, whatever benefit ... I mean, obviously there is a benefit to being white in this country, and he was willing to die for that.", "CHRIS HAYES: And you see that in many places.", "JONATHAN METZL: I see that kind of politics. I don't think it was ... It's not quite as apparent across the board. Some people were overtly racist and said it to me. I do see that strain of our bodily concerns are secondary to this bigger ideology. We're defending whiteness like a fortress.", "CHRIS HAYES: Although they never call it whiteness.", "JONATHAN METZL: Right.", "CHRIS HAYES: I mean, very rarely I think. In the book and I think generally in our politics, it's not constructed by the folks defending it as such, right?", "JONATHAN METZL: It's funny in that regard-", "CHRIS HAYES: It's like real America or whatever the-", "JONATHAN METZL: It's hard, I'm telling you personally, it's hard to talk about whiteness. I mean, my last book was about black power protesters, and I would go on television all the time and talk about the black power movement and Black Panthers and things like that. It was cool. But now when I go on TV and I talk about whiteness, the minute I say whiteness, all of a sudden it's like, \"You're a white traitor. You're a white sell out.\" So even talking about whiteness itself is risky, right? Because what you're doing is it's like exposing what's behind the curtain or you're looking too hard. So I agree with that, but I do think that tension lies beneath many of the issues and guns is another great example. There's this whole racial history of guns, and if you understand that racial history about who got to own a gun, then you understand, for example, why the castle doctrine, as one example, this idea that a man's home and his car and his everything else is a fortress is such a powerful motif in gun culture because of this idea that basically this libertarian white idea that you're defending your ... It's not just a castle of a castle, it's a castle of whiteness is what I talk about.", "And another example would be why is it that when white open carry advocates in the south, they can walk into Walmart or they can go buy coffee or go to Starbucks, but when black open carry advocates walk into Walmart, they get tackled or arrested or shot. There's the whole racial politics around these issues that isn't called racial politics, but it underlies many of these issues. So I'm just trying to expose that because I think it's better if we talk about it.", "CHRIS HAYES: When you talk about the ideology being whiteness, I guess my question is like why has it gotten worse? Is it the dawning demographic eclipse that looms in the future?", "JONATHAN METZL: I think that there's something very important happening right now, and let me be clear, you asked about whiteness, and I'm not making ... I have no idea what anybody's thinking. I don't know what's in anybody's heart. I don't know who's racist and who's not. We're very good at covering that up in any case. And I'm not making any claim about whiteness as biology.", "CHRIS HAYES: No, no, no. Very clearly, it's about a sort of constructed social category with very real and tangible affects.", "JONATHAN METZL: And part of those tangible effects are not because people are racist, they're because concerns about the loss of white authority that were fringe narratives in this country for a while or they were regional narratives in this country for a while, worked their way into community, county, city, state politics. So the risk I'm talking about of whiteness is not whether you're racist. It's whether you live in a state where the state health authority is setting policies about healthcare or guns or schools that set state policy. The risk is actually the policy and so what I'm talking about is how these backlash politics that were not setting state agendas, there was a much more centrist agenda in the states I talked about, but the minute they start setting policies that impact people's health, that's when people start dying of whiteness and instead of saying \"Oh my God, look what happened in Tennessee when they didn't expand, let's not do that.\u201d Or \u201clook what happened in Missouri when we spread a lot of guns, lets not do that.\u201d Instead what we're seeing is that these horrible state policies are becoming the platform for the Trump administration.", "CHRIS HAYES: And in some ways the variable here, right, is that the intensity of the backlash, particularly in 2010 in terms of the real transfer of power is that you get, nine years ago you get this transfer of power and many of these, what you talk about is a regional problem, places like Kansas, places like Missouri, places like Tennessee. Power in the hands of this one party that then begins to implement this agenda.", "JONATHAN METZL: And this liberal fantasy, it was my own fantasy also, but the idea was basically I remember when Trump got elected and there were all these articles in the paper that were like \u201cwhen voters see what's going to happen when farmers see what tariffs do, they're going to wake up.\u201d Or \u201cwhen people see that they're not going to get covered by health care.\u201d And I was like look, I just wrote a book about this, and I guarantee you when they see that they're going to become more supportive of Trump. In a way the more extreme people's situations get the more ideological they get and so in a way, unless you can present an argument that's going to convince them that you're going to better these particular issues, I feel like just them turning on Trump because a curtain is pulled up was, I mean again, we were all shocked by that election in one way or another, but I would say that when people started saying \u201cpeople in the south just need empathy or that when they see what's really happening\u2026\u201d and I kept saying like my book's not out yet, but if my book was here I would tell you that actually when that starts happening they're going to become more ideologically driven, not less.", "CHRIS HAYES: I mean we've seen, I've seen interviews with farmers who are literally having their bottom line affected by these tariffs, right, it's very clear. The president launched this sort of trade war with China, he's imposed tariffs, they've responded by not buying American soybeans. Soybeans are one of the biggest export crop we have, you can go and stick a microphone in the face of a bunch of farmers across the Midwest who grow and sell soybeans who are like \"Yes, I can read off my spreadsheet the dollar value that this has hurt me. I'm still behind Trump.\"", "JONATHAN METZL: Displacement, first of all, is a very powerful tool so as long as that's somebody else's fault, I will say to be fair, a lot of people who were suffering also felt like Trump was standing up for their interests and he was their champion and so in a particular way I did come to appreciate that these politics were giving people something that was not quantifiable by the analytic tool that I was using. It was this sense of \u201cI'm part of an ideologically-driven mission in a particular way\u201d or something like that.", "CHRIS HAYES: Right. And I mean I say this to people on the left all the time, there's ton of people on the left for whom this is true. Speaking for myself, I and I know people in New York who have voted for many candidates who literally would materially make their taxes go up, would reduce their bottom line and no one's like you're crazy. What's wrong with you? Don't you realize that? And it's like no, actually, there are other things important to me. It's more important to me to have a society that is just and equitable and pluralistic and diverse and doesn't separate children at the border, than what happens to my tax rate. I have concerns that are not material. Somehow it just seems weird to people in the other direction but it's just like, everyone's walking around with these concerns.", "JONATHAN METZL: Right, think about it.", "CHRIS HAYES: What's our place in the world? What's our place in the country? Who are we? Those are the essential ones. There's this idea that the material concerns are the real ones. Or why don't people like, and actually it's the other way around. Who you are, the concerns about identity, who you are, what community are you a part of, where do you stand in the story of the nation, how central are you, what are you inherit, what can you lay claim to? That's the stuff.", "JONATHAN METZL: I just wrote a book about health and I can tell you that it made me humble that health is just one part of identity. I rode to this interview today on a Citi Bike and I didn't wear a bike helmet. There are candidates that I voted for that have done bad things to my own interests, or that have spread policies that are bad for people in dense urban areas, or HIV policy, or you name it. And so in a way, it's important to recognize as you suggest that health is just one of the indicators, but identity is this big, big complicated thing. And when people say like what's going to change people's minds I'll say \"Well let me ask you a question. What kind of argument would somebody need to make to you so that you would carry around an AR-15?\" In other words, there's nothing I can think of that would make me do that for myself, and so-", "CHRIS HAYES: Literally nothing.", "JONATHAN METZL: Yeah.", "CHRIS HAYES: You literally, there's literally nothing you can convince me. I mean I'm trying to think. I guess my answer to that would be an actual apocalyptic breakdown in society, which like-", "JONATHAN METZL: \"Walking Dead\" or-", "CHRIS HAYES: Right, exactly. \"Walking Dead.\" I guess if it were like the \"Walking Dead\" I would get an AR-15 and try and shoot the zombies so they didn't get my kids.", "JONATHAN METZL: Right, right. But again so that's what we're getting at. Now again, this is part and parcel of why I'm trying to argue that our disputes should not be about identity because people's identities are really complicated. But when it's about policy then I feel like it's actually a bit more mutable, maybe I'm, you're smiling, maybe I'm being more idealistic at this point in the conversation.", "CHRIS HAYES: Well, it's funny because we just had this whole conversation about how deeply bound these identities are. And you're talking about, you write about this in the book about these sort of suicides support groups, the most intense type of visceral grief and loss, I don't know. I don't want to have sort of despair. I do think that persuasion's possible and people do change their minds, but I don't know how do you redirect away from this very visceral sense that they are bound up in a project that's preserving some part of their place in the world even if it's doing material harm?", "JONATHAN METZL: Two ways. One, it's not my job to change anybody's minds. In other words, part of that narrative actually has to come from working class white communities. If there's a progressive conservative movement for example. Something that basically says we're conservative but we also want more out of our elected officials for our own lives. That will be a game changer. Again, that's not coming from me. I would tell people, what would it take to turn on Trump and they'd laugh at me. But I do think it's fair that there could be a movement within conservatism that actually, there's no historical precedent for that. So one would be a movement within conservatism that actually also wants healthcare and education and betterment. But the other is just, we're so polarized that the issues feel so impossible.", "I'm sighing right now as I tell you this in a particular way, but it's not like people haven't changed course politically when a politician offered them something that seemed to better their own material circumstances. And the Democrats, there were problems with the Democratic formulation but the Democrats were the experts at that for 50 years, 100 years. And so in a way, the reason why I have a hard time answering this question is because sometimes when I talk to Democrats and they're like the Trump base is like this big iceberg in the middle of the Atlantic and it's never going to change or go away and I'm like actually that's not right. You're just not offering something that is resonating in a way-", "CHRIS HAYES: But wait a second. I feel like you're arguing on the other side of this. Because if the whole point is, people have non material concerns, what can I offer you, I can offer you here, I'll give you $1,000 a month and I'll give you healthcare and I'll give you all these things, but you're going to have to give up your centeredness in the national story as a white man. Because I'm just not going to reify that because that's actually not what our coalition's about because we just can't be about that. And like you can take or leave that trade, but the whole point is that, I guess it's all relative. What is the material bid that you can move someone off of their, there's some market exchange rate, right, for like the value of whiteness where it's like what's it going to take? But the point is that's high.", "JONATHAN METZL: Very high.", "CHRIS HAYES: And what I can't, what I cannot give you as a Democratic candidate in the year 2019 in the era of pluralizing diverse 21st century post-Obama America, I cannot give you the thing. I can't counter offer the thing that Donald Trump is offering you. I can't. I cannot say \"You're right, white man. That you have it the worst. And that these other people are coming to take your shit.\u201d", "JONATHAN METZL: No, I think 1,000 percent agree with you. And I think you're right to call me on that in a particular-", "CHRIS HAYES: I'm not calling you. It's a fascinating question to me. It's just like an unresolved one.", "JONATHAN METZL: I mean part of the issue statistically speaking is that policies, I mean it's the flip of my argument that policies that are supposedly bad for minority and immigrant communities end up being really bad for white populations. The flip side is true also that policies that help working class white people also help working class people across the board and so for me-", "CHRIS HAYES: Often on disparate levels. In absolute sense, yes, but disparately.", "JONATHAN METZL: Disparate, right, exactly right. But there are obviously bigger structural problems and so in a way I guess that's the piece I'm trying to hold on to. Is to say I don't want to give up on thinking about initiatives that are going to help working class people because they are actually going to help people across the board. For me that's the potential promise of a potential progressive movement if it's going to spread beyond what it is right now, which is actually that it's making promises or slogans or ideologies about particular stances or particular positions that end up being potentially beneficial even for the people I'm talking about in this book.", "CHRIS HAYES: Part of the sort of deep question that I keep returning to, and we've had several conversations about this. I talked to Nikole Hannah-Jones about this and I've talked to Ta-Nehisi Coates about it, there's two ways of looking at the value of whiteness. So one way is that it's essentially whiteness is used as a wedge that makes people in general at the bottom of the social hierarchy worse off. So that's one argument. And I think there's a strong argument to say that America doesn't have the sort of welfare state that comparable OECD countries have because of the wedge of race, and we have lower, we have worse life expectancy, we have higher incarcerations rates among white people, we have higher maternal mortality among white people, again disparate but across OECD, still worse right here. So it's a net negative, right. It ends up screwing the very people that are sort of the part, at the crux of it. That's one argument and think is the argument you make in your book.", "But the argument that Nikole Hannah-Jones make is actually it works out well. White people do get the better part of stuff. Like they do, they are better educated, they do have better health outcomes. That we want to tell ourselves oh they're actually screwing themselves in some way, but when you look at it, who's got most of the pie? They're doing alright.", "JONATHAN METZL: There's a tremendous obviously defensiveness of this particular construction of whiteness that we're talking about and in a minute I just want to make clear that I'm not talking about all white people, I'm talking about a policy, but of course there is a particular sense of anxiety about demographic change that white populations actually have that particular material benefit and it's at risk because of demographic changes or globalization or changing workforce or other people rising up through the ranks and so it's not so much that white people are worse off, it's that there's a fear that basically this particular position that people are holding on to so deeply, is at risk of falling. And certainly I think that you see this in the gun debate for example, I mean ads for example that I talk about in the book quite clearly reference that particular history. That the world may be changing, but if you're protecting yourself with a Glock, it'll restore the balance of power in a way.", "And so there is this sense of, it's a sense of holding on. It's not a sense of just we're victims in a particular way. And then I also think other people have written about this, just a sense of oh I have a psychiatrist but I hate to use the word guilt, but there is a kind of sense of kind of, you're stuck in this box in a way and I think, just again, I did feel talking to a lot of people that if there was some way to get people out of this particular construction, they might have taken it, but it was beyond the framework of knowing how to actually, how can we get out this situation where we were the enslavers at a particular point. Where we drive to work and there are people who are much worse off than us but I think that there was just so much anxiety and again, all the rhetoric was basically saying people are going to carjack you or they're going to steal your big screen TV or something like that and so there was just no way out of this box. I mean, part of what I'm writing about is not just about this dying thing, it's about the box of whiteness and how we can't get out of that.", "But I do just want to make one other point about that, which is there were many white people who didn't spout this narrative that I talked to and the whole conclusion of the book is talking about examples of really brave remarkable people that I met across the course of my work, talking to school board people in Kansas and people who were working against gun violence in low income communities who were saying similar things to what we were, but they were red state Republicans.", "CHRIS HAYES: Totally. Yeah I mean it's always really important to talk about the fact that you just can't, we're talking about millions of people and people have all sorts of idiosyncrasies and this is a point that we've made before on the podcast that if a county of 10,000 people in a red county, right, that goes 70-30 for Trump, you're talking about 3,000 people in that county who didn't vote for him.", "JONATHAN METZL: And this leads back to policy, right. That there are many ways to be white, there are many expressions of whiteness and part of my frustration is that the dominant mode of who gets to define whiteness, the biggest megaphone right now is in a way the worst one. So it's exactly this politics is what's crowding out all the other rhetorics and part of the point I make in the conclusion is there's so many other ways to be white that are generous and compassionate and multi-cultural and thinking we're the demographic majority, it's our responsibility to take care of immigrants. There are all these other things in our country and so part of the issue, and that's why I focus on policy is to say that we've let our worst angels set the health policies. That that's really the moment that we have to push back on.", "CHRIS HAYES: Jonathan Metzl is a psychiatrist and a sociologist. He's the director of the Center for Medicine, Heath, and Society at Vanderbilt University.
